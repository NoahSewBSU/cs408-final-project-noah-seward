# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

The general theme of this website is a fun, autonomous "chat room" with a twist - only one saved message at a time, and 
no real way to confirm who you're speaking with. This site is going to offer users a chance to read a message from a "bottle", 
and decide whether or not to replace that message with their own for others to see. The target audience of this site is 
mostly those seeking a novel experience - probably bored people at work, school, or those trying to enjoy their sick leave. 
This site will mainly manage strings given by the users; simple messages with a max character count that will be filtered 
before being stored for the next user to retrieve. This site has a lot of potential stretch goals - although it is a simple 
concept, the ceiling to this concept can get pretty high pretty fast. The beginning will start with simple functionality - 
I'll create simple start message, PUT that message in the db, let the site GET that message for the user, then, if the user 
decides to replace it, let the site DELETE that message and PUT the new message in the db for the next user (or current). 
This simple design will involve no animations or wild formatting, just to make sure the site works. Then, these can be added! 
Animations for the bottle, color to the page (or lack-of in order to keep it clean), maybe even a custom font for the messages 
to look more like written ones you'd assume to find in bottles. Beyond that, further stretch goals would be to add several 
bottles, then perhaps a voting system on what messages get stored in which bottles, perhaps a land-locked method that keeps 
users on their respective 'lands' yet allows them to send bottles to other lands - the sky gets pretty wide with some creativity.
